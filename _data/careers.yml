    detail:  As a senior full-stack software engineer with five years at NYSE-listed Tencent Music, I contributed to the development of 'WeSing' and 'QQMusic,' apps with over 100 million daily active users. I hold international patents, including WO2023011050 and 113596516. My five-year work experience in Computer Science. At Tencent Music, a NYSE-listed internet company renowned for its applications such as 'WeSing' and 'QQMusic' with over 100 million daily active users, my role as a staff senior full-stack software engineer over the past five years has not only given me hands-on experience in Computer Science, but also involved tackling challenges like optimizing audio and video transmission structures and algorithms to overcome app latency issues. As the lead of our development team, I spearheaded the design and development of an efficient audio-video processing framework for online choral singing, based on optimizing audio-video compression structures and algorithms, as evidenced by my co-authored patent (WO2023011050). This framework, successfully deployed in apps for years and supporting millions globally in daily online choral singing, not only reduced bandwidth for live streaming but also enabled real-time musical collaborations at long distances with minimal audio delays, even in less-than-ideal network conditions.  Furthermore, my work involved research on machine learning algorithms for image feature extraction within apps. A notable achievement (patent 113596516) was the development of a novel approach for constructing Random-Forest-Models, which improves data efficiency by building decision trees from diverse sample subsets and then systematically integrating these to enhance the model. Through these efforts, I have gained substantial experience in optimizing machine learning algorithms for commercial projects
